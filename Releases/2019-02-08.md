Load Sheet Generation

‌

* Multi-user issues with Load Sheet has been resolved
* Load Sheet data sync
  * Introduced “Begin” functionality
  * Once a load sheet is assigned, data continuously flows to the drivers. All updates that the dispatchers make will show up on the portal.
  * Before the lead driver “Begins” the load sheet, the load sheet can be viewed “Read-only”
  * The “Begin” feature is available to the lead driver ½ hour before call time
  * Once the lead driver selects “Begin”, data stops flowing to the portal and data starts flowing the other way – toward Harrisburg
